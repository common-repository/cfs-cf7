Contact Form 7 field for Custom Field Suite

== Description ==

Tihs plugin creates a new type of field into [Custom Field Suite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-field-suite/): the user can select any form generated with [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).

You can get the form HTML using `CFS()->get( 'form_field_id' )` or the form ID using `CFS()->get( 'form_field_id', get_the_ID(), array( 'format' => 'raw' ) )`.

Note: Obviously, this plugin requires both *Custom Field Suite* and *Contact Form 7* to work.
